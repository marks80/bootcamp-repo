This repository serves as an archive for my homework, labwork, and badges earned during the Accenture Baltic Bootcamp: Cloud & Automation with Data Intelligence, which took place from January 13th to February 7th. The bootcamp focused on equipping participants with cutting-edge skills in cloud technologies, automation, and data intelligence, preparing us for the next-generation IT landscape.

During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with industry-leading tools and technologies, including AWS, Snowflake, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, Git, and more. This repository organizes my work into modules, reflecting the topics covered during the program.

Throughout the bootcamp, I earned several badges for completing modules and demonstrating proficiency in key areas.

Acknowledgments

I want to say a huge thank you to the Accenture Baltic team and our amazing trainers for making this bootcamp such a great experience. Your support, knowledge, and dedication have been truly inspiring. 

This bootcamp was not easy—it pushed me out of my comfort zone more than once. There were moments of struggle, new technologies to grasp, and tough challenges to overcome. But that’s exactly what made it so valuable. I learned to adapt, think critically, and push through difficulties, and I’m coming out of this experience stronger and more confident than ever.

One of the best things about this journey was the team spirit. Those who had more experience were always ready to help those who were still learning, and that kind of support and collaboration made all the difference.

I truly believe that each of you has a bright future ahead in IT, and I can’t wait to see what you all achieve.

As we move forward, I wish you success, exciting opportunities, and a career full of growth and happiness.

To the Accenture Baltic team—thank you for everything! Your guidance and encouragement have made a real difference, and I am truly grateful for this opportunity.

Thank you all for an unforgettable experience! Wishing you all success in 2025 and beyond!
