# bootcamp-repo
This repository serves as an archive for my homework, labwork, and badges earned during the Accenture Baltic Bootcamp: Cloud & Automation with Data Intelligence, which took place from January 13th to February 7th. The bootcamp focused on equipping participants with cutting-edge skills in cloud technologies, automation, and data intelligence, preparing us for the next-generation IT landscape.

During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with industry-leading tools and technologies, including AWS, Snowflake, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, Git, and more. This repository organizes my work into modules, reflecting the topics covered during the program.
