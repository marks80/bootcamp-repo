Bash Scripting Tasks: What I Learned
This repository contains 12 Bash scripts developed as solutions to various scripting tasks designed to enhance my understanding of key Bash programming concepts. Below is a summary of the skills and knowledge I gained while completing these tasks:

Key Learnings:
Directory Management and Conditional Logic

Learned how to check for the existence of directories using conditional structures.
Practiced using the du command for calculating directory sizes and realpath for displaying absolute paths.
File Iteration and Command-Line Arguments

Utilized for loops to iterate through files in a directory.
Implemented logic to handle command-line arguments effectively using special variables like $1 and $2.
Explored commands like find and stat to filter files by modification time.
Word Counting in Files

Worked with text processing tools such as grep and loops to count word occurrences in a file.
Gained insight into error handling for missing files or arguments.
Temperature Conversion

Applied conditional structures (if-else) to implement logic for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Practiced handling invalid input gracefully.
Backup Automation

Automated backup processes for multiple directories using loops and conditional checks.
Managed errors such as non-existent directories or failed backup operations, ensuring robustness.
Shell Scripting Best Practices

Improved script readability by using meaningful variable names and comments.
Enhanced scriptsâ€™ robustness with error-checking and user-friendly messages.
Used shell expansion and debugging techniques to troubleshoot effectively.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Bash scripting
Commands: du, realpath, find, stat, grep, cp
Shell variables, loops, and conditional structures
Debugging and error handling techniques.
